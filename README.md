# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview

The AirBnB Clone is a comprehensive full-stack project designed to simulate a real-world booking platform similar to Airbnb.
The goal is to build a robust backend system that manages users, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments — while learning modern software engineering practices.

## Project Goals

* Build a scalable backend architecture using Django and PostgreSQL.
* Understand database design and relationships between entities (users, properties, bookings, etc.).
* Develop RESTful APIs and integrate GraphQL for flexible data queries.
* Implement authentication and authorization for secure access.
* Gain hands-on experience with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and DevOps workflows.
* Collaborate effectively using GitHub version control.

## Team Collaboration

This project encourages teamwork and collaboration.
Each member will take responsibility for different parts of the system — backend development, database design, DevOps setup, or QA testing — following industry-standard workflows through GitHub.

## Outcome

By completing this project, we’ll strengthen our skills in:

* Backend engineering
* Database design
* API development
* Security best practices
* CI/CD automation
* Real-world collaboration
