# 🏠 AirBnB Clone Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **AirBnB Clone** is a comprehensive full-stack project designed to simulate a real-world booking platform similar to Airbnb.  
The goal is to build a **robust backend system** that manages users, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments — while learning modern software engineering practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a scalable **backend architecture** using Django and PostgreSQL.  
- Understand **database design** and relationships between entities (users, properties, bookings, etc.).  
- Develop **RESTful APIs** and integrate **GraphQL** for flexible data queries.  
- Implement **authentication and authorization** for secure access.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **DevOps workflows**.  
- Collaborate effectively using **GitHub version control**.
